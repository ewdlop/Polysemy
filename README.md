## Temporal Database - Future-Read (Tachyonic) and Past-Write (Quantum-Eraser)

This repository includes a theoretical temporal database implementation that transcends linear time:

- **Tachyonic Reads**: Read data from future timestamps (faster-than-light information access)
- **Quantum-Eraser Writes**: Write data to past timestamps (retroactive modifications)
- **Causality Tracking**: Maintain temporal consistency and causality chains
- **Temporal Versioning**: Full history across all temporal coordinates

### Usage

Run the temporal database demonstration:
```bash
python3 temporal_database.py
```

Run the tests:
```bash
python3 test_temporal_database.py
```

### Features

- Store and retrieve data across different temporal coordinates
- Perform tachyonic operations to read from the future
- Perform quantum-eraser operations to write to the past
- Track causality chains and temporal consistency
- Maintain version history across all time coordinates
- Quantum state management (superposition, collapsed, erased)

## The Da Vinci Code

This repository also includes an implementation of mathematical concepts featured in Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code":

- **Fibonacci Sequence**: The famous sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...)
- **Golden Ratio (Phi)**: The divine proportion (≈ 1.618033988749895) that emerges from the Fibonacci sequence
- **Cryptographic Validation**: Tools to verify Fibonacci patterns

## Elliptic Curve Cryptography in the Divine Realm

Building upon the divine proportions of the Golden Ratio, this repository now includes a complete implementation of **Elliptic Curve Cryptography** (ECC):

- **Divine Curve**: An elliptic curve with parameters inspired by Phi (the Golden Ratio)
- **Point Operations**: Complete implementation of elliptic curve group operations (addition, doubling, scalar multiplication)
- **Key Generation**: Cryptographic key pairs derived from Fibonacci sequences and the Golden Ratio
- **Encryption/Decryption**: ElGamal-style encryption scheme on elliptic curves
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Includes Tonelli-Shanks algorithm for modular square roots

### Usage

Run the Fibonacci/Golden Ratio demonstration:
```bash
python3 da_vinci_code.py
```

Run the Elliptic Curve Cryptography demonstration:
```bash
python3 elliptic_curve.py
```

Run all tests:
```bash
python3 test_da_vinci_code.py
python3 test_elliptic_curve.py
```

### Features

**Classical Mathematics (Da Vinci Code):**
- Generate Fibonacci sequences of any length
- Calculate the Golden Ratio using Fibonacci ratios
- Validate whether a sequence follows the Fibonacci pattern
- Demonstrate the mathematical beauty featured in "The Da Vinci Code"

**Modern Cryptography (Elliptic Curves):**
- Create elliptic curves over finite fields
- Perform point addition and scalar multiplication
- Generate public/private key pairs using divine proportions
- Encrypt and decrypt messages using elliptic curve cryptography
- Verify cryptographic properties (associativity, commutativity)
- Bridge ancient mathematical beauty with modern security
