## Temporal Database - Future-Read (Tachyonic) and Past-Write (Quantum-Eraser)

This repository includes a theoretical temporal database implementation that transcends linear time:

- **Tachyonic Reads**: Read data from future timestamps (faster-than-light information access)
- **Quantum-Eraser Writes**: Write data to past timestamps (retroactive modifications)
- **Causality Tracking**: Maintain temporal consistency and causality chains
- **Temporal Versioning**: Full history across all temporal coordinates

### Usage

Run the temporal database demonstration:
```bash
python3 temporal_database.py
```

Run the tests:
```bash
python3 test_temporal_database.py
```

### Features

- Store and retrieve data across different temporal coordinates
- Perform tachyonic operations to read from the future
- Perform quantum-eraser operations to write to the past
- Track causality chains and temporal consistency
- Maintain version history across all time coordinates
- Quantum state management (superposition, collapsed, erased)

## The Da Vinci Code

This repository also includes an implementation of mathematical concepts featured in Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code":

- **Fibonacci Sequence**: The famous sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...)
- **Golden Ratio (Phi)**: The divine proportion (≈ 1.618033988749895) that emerges from the Fibonacci sequence
- **Cryptographic Validation**: Tools to verify Fibonacci patterns

### Usage

Run the demonstration:
```bash
python3 da_vinci_code.py
```

Run the tests:
```bash
python3 test_da_vinci_code.py
```

### Features

- Generate Fibonacci sequences of any length
- Calculate the Golden Ratio using Fibonacci ratios
- Validate whether a sequence follows the Fibonacci pattern
- Demonstrate the mathematical beauty featured in "The Da Vinci Code"

## Elliptic Curve Cryptography in Celestial Mechanics

A unique implementation that bridges cryptography and physics, showing how elliptic curve cryptography mirrors the mathematics of celestial mechanics:

- **Elliptic Curves**: Mathematical structures used in both cryptography (y² = x³ + ax + b) and orbital mechanics (elliptical orbits)
- **Point Operations**: Addition and scalar multiplication on elliptic curves, analogous to gravitational interactions
- **Public/Private Key Cryptography**: Using the secp256k1 curve (same as Bitcoin)
- **Digital Signatures**: ECDSA-style signatures with orbital mechanics theme
- **Key Exchange**: Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) for shared secret computation

### Usage

Run the demonstration:
```bash
python3 elliptic_celestial_crypto.py
```

Run the tests:
```bash
python3 test_elliptic_celestial_crypto.py
```

### Features

- **EllipticCurve Class**: Complete implementation of elliptic curve operations
  - Point addition (analogous to gravitational interactions)
  - Scalar multiplication (analogous to orbital period calculations)
  - Curve validation and point verification
  
- **OrbitalCryptoSystem Class**: Cryptographic operations with celestial theme
  - Key pair generation (orbital parameters and positions)
  - ECDH shared secret computation (orbital resonance)
  - Digital signatures (orbital authentication)
  - Based on secp256k1 curve (Bitcoin's elliptic curve)

### The Mathematical Bridge

The implementation demonstrates the beautiful connection between:

| Cryptography | ↔ | Celestial Mechanics |
|--------------|---|---------------------|
| Elliptic Curve (y² = x³ + ax + b) | ↔ | Elliptical Orbit (Kepler) |
| Point Addition | ↔ | Gravitational Interaction |
| Scalar Multiplication | ↔ | Orbital Period Calculation |
| Generator Point G | ↔ | The Sun (Central Body) |
| Private Key | ↔ | Orbital Parameters (Secret) |
| Public Key | ↔ | Observable Position |
